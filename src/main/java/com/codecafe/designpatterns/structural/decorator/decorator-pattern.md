## Decorator Pattern

* Decorator is a structural pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside
  special wrapper objects.


* Using decorators you can wrap objects countless number of times since both target objects and decorators follow the
  same interface.


* The resulting object will get a stacking behavior of all wrappers.


* This is a good choice in the following cases:
  - When we wish to add, enhance or even remove the behavior or state of objects.
  - When we just want to modify the functionality of a single object of class and leave others unchanged.
